    "In this scenario, you’re a security analyst investigating traffic to a website.\n",

    "You’ll analyze a network packet capture file that contains traffic data related to a user connecting to an internet site. The ability to filter network traffic using packet sniffers to gather relevant information is an essential skill as a security analyst.\n",

    "You must filter the data in order to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- identify the source and destination IP addresses involved in this web browsing session,\n",
    "- examine the protocols that are used when the user makes the connection to the website, and\n",
    "- analyze some of the data packets to identify the type of information sent and received by the systems that connect to each other when the network data is captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll open the packet capture file and explore the basic Wireshark graphic user interface. Second, you’ll open a detailed view of a single packet and explore how to examine the various protocol and data layers inside a network packet. Third, you’ll apply filters to select and inspect packets based on specific criteria. Fourth, you’ll filter and inspect UDP DNS traffic to examine protocol data. Finally, you’ll apply filters to TCP packet data to search for specific payload text data."

    "Not all the data packets are the same color. Coloring rules are used to provide high-level visual cues to help you quickly classify the different types of data. Since network packet capture files can contain large amounts of data, you can use coloring rules to quickly identify the data that is relevant to you. The example packet lists a group of light blue packets that all contain DNS traffic, followed by green packets that contain a mixture of TCP and HTTP protocol traffic."
